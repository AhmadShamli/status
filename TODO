+  Stuff to do!               +
+ --------------------------- +

* Show disk space (used/total)
* Setup script
* Administration interface (perhaps ignore setup script, initial stuff is done from here?)
* Email on high load/disk space usage/etc
* Add new field to specify how many cores a VPS has (get from daemon possibly?) to allow for accurate load colours and emails
